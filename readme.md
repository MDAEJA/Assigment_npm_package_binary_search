# Binary Search Implementation

This project implements a simple binary search algorithm to find a specific value within a sorted array or list. It is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the basic concepts of binary search, including how to set up and run the search function.

## Overview
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list or array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements each time until the desired value is found or the list is exhausted.

## Getting Started
To use the binary search function, ensure that you have [required programming language or environment]. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the search.

### Prerequisites
- [Programming language, e.g., Python 3.8+]
- [Any other dependencies, if needed]

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-search.git
